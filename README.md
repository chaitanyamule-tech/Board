KANBAN TASK BOARD (Drag & Drop)

A simple yet powerful Kanban Task Management Board built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
This project supports drag-and-drop task movement, persistent storage using localStorage, and real-time task count updates, making it a practical example of real-world frontend state management.

🚀 FEATURES :

1. Create tasks with title and description
2. Drag & Drop tasks between Todo, In Progress, and Done columns
3. Live task count update for each column
4. Delete tasks instantly
5. Persistent data storage using localStorage (tasks remain after page reload)
6. Clean and modular JavaScript logic
7. Responsive and user-friendly UI

🛠️ Tech Stack :-

HTML5 – Structure
CSS3 – Styling & drag effects
JavaScript (ES6) – Logic, events, and state management
localStorage – Data persistence


🧠 Project Highlights :-

Separation of UI (DOM) and data (localStorage)

Centralized state updates for better maintainability

Real-world implementation of Drag & Drop API

Beginner-friendly yet interview-ready architecture




📦 How It Works

Tasks are stored as JavaScript objects in localStorage

On page load, tasks are fetched and rendered dynamically

Any action (add / delete / drag-drop) updates both the UI and storage

Task counts update automatically based on column state
